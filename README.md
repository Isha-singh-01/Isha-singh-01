## About Me
I recently completed my **Master’s in Data Science** from Northeastern University and am currently working as a **Data Scientist at Bose**. I am passionate about **Machine Learning, NLP, and Generative AI**, and enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights.  

I have experience in **building, deploying, and monitoring ML models (MLOps)**, operationalizing LLM pipelines, predictive and forecasting models, and interactive dashboards. I thrive on solving real-world business problems with data, and I’m always exploring new AI technologies to improve production workflows.
